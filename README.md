' The problem is that for a publication database in excel file there are multiple authors in a cell
' the Objective is to create additional rows in such a manner that each author appears only once in a row and there are equally rows with the same title

'
'before starting the function make sure that all the authors are separated by comma only
' replace all the "and" and "/" characters with comma (",") using find and replace
' r:row number
' c: author column
